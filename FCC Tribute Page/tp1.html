                <h2>Timeline of Einsteins contributions to mankind</h2>
                <p class="first-text">Albert Einstein, a man whose name is practically synonymous with genius, is one of
                    history's greatest thinkers. His theories of relativity led to new ways of looking at time, space,
                    matter, energy and gravity. His work led to important
                    advances including the control of atomic energy, space exploration, and applications of light.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1905:</strong> His Special Theory of Relativity is born and he applies his theory to
                        mass and energy and formulates the famous equation e=mc2.</li>
                    <li><strong>1907:</strong> Einstein begins applying the laws of gravity to his Special Theory of
                        Relativity.</li>
                    <li><strong>1910:</strong> He writes a paper on critical opalescence that described why the sky is
                        blue.</li>
                    <li><strong>1911:</strong> Einstein predicts bending of light.</li>
                    <li><strong>1913:</strong> He is appointed Professor of theoretical physics at the Federal Institute
                        of Technology, Zurich and works on his new Theory of Gravity.</li>
                    <li><strong>1915:</strong> Einstein completes the General Theory of Relativity. He joins the "New
                        Fatherland League" a pacifist organisation.</li>
                    <li><strong>1917:</strong> Einstein writes his first paper on cosmology.</li>
                    <li><strong>1922:</strong> Albert Einstein is awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for 1921</li>
                    <li><strong>1927:</strong> He begins to develop the foundation of quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1928:</strong> Einstein begins pursing his idea of a unified field theory.</li>
                    <li><strong>1934:</strong> The World As I See It published</li>
                    <li><strong>1935:</strong> The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is published</li>
                    <li><strong>1939:</strong> World War 2 starts and Albert Einstein warns President Roosevelt that
                        Germany might build an atomic bomb. He then recommends nuclear research</li>
                    <li><strong>1955:</strong> Co-signs the Russell-Einstein Manifesto warning of the nuclear threat
                    </li>
                </ul>
